# Simple Calendar
A Simple Calendar is a front-end web development project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view the current month, navigate between months, and see the correct number of days for each month in a clean, easy-to-use layout.

# Features
 - Current Month View: Displays the current month and year by default.
 - Month Navigation: Users can navigate between months using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
 - Day Display: Each day of the month is shown in a grid format, with the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) displayed at the top.
 - Responsive Design: The calendar adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
# Technologies Used
 - HTML: To structure the calendar, including the layout and interactive elements like buttons.
 - CSS: For styling the calendar and ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.
 - JavaScript: To dynamically generate the current month, manage navigation between months, and calculate the days for each month.
# Getting Started
To use the Simple Calendar, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calendar.git
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Open the index.html file in a browser to view the calendar.
# How It Works
 1.JavaScript
     - The JavaScript script uses the Date object to determine the current month, year, and the correct number of days.
     - It also calculates the starting day of the month (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.) to properly align the days in the grid.
     - Event listeners on the "Previous" and "Next" buttons allow users to navigate between months.
2. CSS
     - The calendar layout uses CSS Grid to create a neat and responsive grid for the days of the month.
     - Flexbox is used for arranging the buttons and ensuring a responsive layout across different screen sizes.
# Future Enhancements
  - Event Functionality: Add the ability for users to add events to specific dates on the calendar.
  - Holiday Marking: Highlight specific holidays or special dates.
  - UI Improvements: Further enhance the visual appearance with more styling, animations, or transitions.
